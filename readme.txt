Dropdown menu in the posts filter of the single choice is changed to multi-select.

== Description ==

Normally, the dropdown menu of the posts filter is a single selection. If you install this plug-in, dropdown menu of "single selection" will change to "multiple choice".
For example, if you select some of the categories, you will be able to view the `post` belonging to any of them in the post list page.

= Some features: =

* Change each pull-down menu on the post list page from single selection to multiple selection.
* Sort the post data by the last modified date and time.
* Tags and author filters will be added to allow you to narrow down your search.
